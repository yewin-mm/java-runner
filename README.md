# java-runner
* This is the sample shell script to run `Java Archive` known as `JAR`.
* Even those you can run Java Application with many ways like run with Tomcat or Jboss or dockerized or etc., sometimes, you may need to run your Jar file with sample command like `java -jar app.jar`.
* So, this script is for that case. 
* You can use this script in any Linux Os and Mac OS.
* You can even run multiple `JAR` files by using this script and so, this script file can handle for many Java Applications with necessary action like `running`, `restarting`, `stopping`.
* You can see below [Instruction](#instruction) section as for command sample to use this shell script.

## ‚ö°Ô∏èAbout The Project
This script is to run `JAR` files. <br>
You can use this script to run your applications in server.<br>
You can even run multiple `JAR` files by using this script and so, this script file can handle for many Java Applications with necessary action like `running`, `restarting`, `stopping`.

<a name="built-with"></a>
### ü™ì Built With
This project is built with
* Bash (You can use this script in any `Linux Os`)

<a name="getting-started"></a>

You can see below [Instruction](#instruction) section as for command sample to use this shell script.
Your OS have to be Linux based OS.

<a name="before-you-begin"></a>
### üîî Before you begin
You need JAR file to test this script and make sure your JAR file is able to run with `java -jar {jar name}`.


<a name="clone-project"></a>
### ü•° Clone Project
* Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yewin-mm/java-runner.git
   ```
<a name="prerequisites"></a>
### üîë Prerequisites
No need to add any special prerequisites. Just clone with above git clone command and your OS have to be Linux OS or Mac Os.


<a name="instruction"></a>
### üìù Instruction
You need JAR file and that jar file is able to run (executable) with `java -jar {jar name}`.
So, Please make sure your jar file is able to run first.

<a name="start"></a>
#### Start Services
* You can start (run) your applications by using this script.
* Go to this java runner script file folder with `terminal`.
* If your user have root permission, Type
  ```sh
    sh java_runner.sh start
  ```
* If your user have not root permission, Type
  ```sh
    sudo sh java_runner.sh start
  ```
* There, you can see this script will request the service name which you want to `run`.
* In there, You can type `any name` you want and please note that `avoid special characters` in service name as my script will accept only for alphanumeric only.
* After that, the script will request your `JAR` file name.
* Add your JAR file name in there.
* Please note that if your JAR file is `not in the same directory` with this script, you need to type JAR file name which `including the valid path`. (eg. /home/app/employeeService.jar).
* After that you can see the message like service is `successfully started`, and you can call your application as it's alive after starting the service.
* Please note that, my script `won't generate log file` to see your application logs.
* So, if you want to see your application logs, you need to generate logs file by using logging tools like log4j, etc.

* There you can see your restarted application is alive, and you can call your application to check your application is alive or not.

<a name="stop"></a>
#### Stop Services
* You can stop your applications if you start your applications by using this script.
* Go to this java runner script file folder with `terminal`.
* If your user have root permission, Type
  ```sh
